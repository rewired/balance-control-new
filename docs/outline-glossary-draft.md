# **BALANCE // CONTROL**

## **Canonical Rulebook (Draft Structure)**

*(single source of truth · tagged · English · player-friendly)*

---

## Introduction

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

What this game is about, at a high level.
No rules, no setup, no mechanics.
Tone: elegant, political, neutral.

---

## Design Premise

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

The core ideas the system is built on:

* influence over ownership
* instability instead of permanence
* responsibility without protection

This section explains *why* the rules work the way they do, not *how*.

---

## Glossary

**[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-01][EXP-02][EXP-03]**

> **Normative.**
> Every term used anywhere else must be defined here.

### Draft Glossary Entries (to be finalized later)

**Tile**
A physical hex tile placed on the table.

**Tile Type**
The functional category of a tile (e.g. Resource Tile, Committee, Focus Tile).

**Tile Class**
All tiles with the same tile type and the same value.

**Tile Set**
The complete defined list of tile classes and their quantities.

**Resource**
A marker representing political capacity used to pay costs or enable actions.

**Public Supply (Bank)**
The neutral pool holding all resources not owned by players.

**Influence**
The only scoring element of the game, represented by influence markers.

**Majority**
A player having more influence on a tile than any other player.

**Tie**
Two or more players having the same highest influence on a tile.

**Focus Tile**
A tile that triggers a one-time political resolution when fully surrounded.

**Committee**
A tile that allows the formalization of new influence.

**Grassroots**
A tile that allows inefficient resource conversion.

**Noise**
A public pool of resources that are politically ineffective.

*(Glossary will expand, but this is the semantic backbone.)*

## Components

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

Physical components only.
No rules.

* Tiles
* Influence markers
* Resource markers
* Noise pool

---

## Tile System

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

How tiles are categorized and understood:

* tile types
* values
* adjacency relevance

No quantities.
No setup.
No effects.

---

## Setup

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

* Core setup (2–4 players)
* Additional steps for 5–6 players

Only procedural steps.

---

## Turn Structure

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

What a turn is, structurally:

* phases
* limits
* timing language

No strategy, no examples yet.

---

## Influence & Majorities

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

How influence works:

* placement
* movement
* limits
* majority logic
* ties

This is the mathematical heart of the system.

---

## Focus Tiles

**[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-03]**

How focus tiles resolve:

* enclosure
* timing
* majority checks
* no-effect cases

Expansion tags only where they actually add behavior.

---

## Round Resolution

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

End-of-round logic:

* resource production
* tie splitting
* noise generation

No economy yet, just resolution mechanics.

---

## Committees

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

Formalizing influence:

* prerequisites
* costs
* limits

---

## Grassroots (Conversion)

**[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-01]**

Resource conversion rules:

* inefficiency
* limits
* expansion extensions

---

## Noise

**[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-01][EXP-02][EXP-03]**

Definition and behavior of noise:

* how it is created
* what it does *not* do
* explicit future openness

This section is intentionally strict.

---

## End of the Game

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

* when the game ends
* how winners are determined
* shared victories

---

## Expansions

### Economy & Labor

**[EXP-01]**

Only what this expansion adds or modifies:

* new resource
* new tiles
* measures

No repetition of core rules.

---

### Security & Order

**[EXP-02]**

* restrictions
* additional costs
* control mechanics

Strictly additive.

---

### Climate & Future

**[EXP-03]**

* pressure mechanics
* temporary regulation
* future-oriented constraints

---

## Appendices

### Appendix A – Tile Sets

**[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-01][EXP-02][EXP-03]**

Human-readable, canonical tile lists:

* Core (2–4)
* Core Extension (5–6)
* Each Expansion

Only tile classes + counts.
No rules.

---

### Appendix B – Markers & Pools

**[CORE-14][CORE-56]**

Formal overview of:

* influence markers
* resource markers
* bank
* noise

---

## ✅ What this solves (explicitly)

* One **canonical language**
* One **semantic source**
* One **extractable structure**
* Zero ambiguity for JSON / contracts
* No more drift between documents
