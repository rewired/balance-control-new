# BALANCE // CONTROL

# Canonical Rulebook (English)

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Introduction

BALANCE // CONTROL is a strategic tile‑laying game about political influence, institutional processes, and time‑critical decisions.

In this game, nothing is owned. Power emerges exclusively through influence on the board.

Resources are visible, majorities are measurable, and outcomes are public — yet control is always temporary.

Politics is not a state. Politics is continuous intervention.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Design Premise

BALANCE // CONTROL models political systems as unstable networks rather than stable economies.

The system is built on the following principles:

* Influence enables action, but never guarantees permanence.
* Equality produces paralysis rather than compromise.
* Power carries responsibility, but offers no protection.

The game does not reward accumulation. It rewards timing, positioning, and the ability to act under uncertainty.

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Components

The game consists of the following components:

* Hexagonal tiles (various tile types)
* Influence markers (player colors)
* Resource markers
* A public Noise pool

No component is hidden at any time.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Tile System

Tiles are placed adjacent to one another to form a shared political space.

Each tile belongs to exactly one tile type. Some tile types also have a numerical value.

Tile values represent political output, not strength or ownership.

Adjacency between tiles is always along hex edges. Diagonal adjacency has no effect.

The specific composition of tiles used in a game is defined by the active tile set.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Setup

### Core Setup (2–4 Players)

[CORE-14]

1. Place the Start Tile at the center of the table.
2. Shuffle all remaining tiles of the active tile set face down.
3. Each player receives starting influence according to player count:

   * 2 players: 4 influence
   * 3 players: 3 influence
   * 4 players: 2 influence
4. Determine a starting player by any agreed method.

### Extended Setup (5–6 Players)

[CORE-56]

1. Add all tiles listed under the Core Tile Set Extension (5–6 Players) to the tile stack.
2. Shuffle all drawable tiles together into a single stack.
3. Complete setup as described above.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Turn Structure

A turn consists of exactly two phases, resolved in order.

### Phase 1: Draw and Place a Tile

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

* Draw the top tile from the tile stack.
* Place it adjacent to at least one existing tile.
* If the tile cannot legally be placed, reveal it, discard it from the game, and draw again.
* Tiles may only be placed on empty table space.
* Placing a tile on top of another tile is not allowed unless explicitly permitted.

### Phase 2: Political Action

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

After placing a tile, the active player performs exactly one political action:

**A) Place or Move Influence**
Place one influence on any tile, or move one of your influence markers to an adjacent tile.
A player may never have more than three influence on the same tile.

**B) Formalize Influence (Committees)**
Requires control of at least one Committee.
Cost: 1 Domestic Policy, 1 Foreign Policy, 1 Media Control.
Gain one influence to your personal supply. It may not be placed this turn.
A player with seven influence may not take this action.

**C) Convert Resources (Grassroots)**
Exchange two identical resources for one resource of any other type.
Only one conversion per turn.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Influence & Majorities

A player controls a tile if they have a relative majority of influence on that tile.

If two or more players are tied for the highest influence, no player controls the tile.

Control may change at any time. There is no inertia or protection.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-03]

## Focus Tiles

When a focus tile becomes completely surrounded, it is resolved immediately.

All influence on the tile is counted. Adjacency bonuses apply.

If a single player has a majority, the focus tile effect is applied.
If there is a tie, no effect occurs.

A focus tile is resolved only once.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Round Resolution

At the end of each round, resource production is resolved.

1. No influence → no production.
2. Clear majority → full production to that player.
3. Tie → resources split evenly (round down); remainder goes to Noise.

Lobbyists count as +1 influence on all adjacent tiles for majority checks.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Committees

Committees enable the formalization of new influence.

They do not produce resources.
Controlling multiple Committees provides no additional benefit.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56][EXP-01]

## Grassroots (Conversion)

Grassroots tiles allow inefficient resource conversion.

Two identical resources may be exchanged for one resource of any other type.
Only one conversion per turn is allowed.

Grassroots tiles do not produce resources.

---

[EXP-01][EXP-02][EXP-03]

## Measures

Measures are one-time political interventions that temporarily modify costs, effects, or permissions.

Measures are **not tiles**, **not resources**, and **not markers**. They represent deliberate political actions taken outside the normal flow of influence placement.

Measures are taken **instead of** performing a political action during a turn.

Rules governing measures:

* A player may hold **up to two measures** at any time.
* A player may play **at most one measure per round**.
* Each individual measure may be resolved **at most twice per game**.
* Measures never generate influence directly.
* Measures never create permanent effects.

Measures always operate by introducing cost pressure, restrictions, delays, or temporary permissions.

---

[EXP-02][EXP-03]

## Overlays (Regulations)

Overlays are persistent modifiers placed on tiles.

An overlay alters how a tile behaves but does not replace or remove the tile itself.

Rules governing overlays:

* Overlays are placed **on tiles**, not on players.
* Overlays apply to **all players** equally.
* Overlays do **not belong** to any player.
* Overlays remain in effect until they are moved, replaced, or explicitly removed by a rule or measure.

Overlays:

* do not generate resources
* do not remove tiles
* do not create hidden information

Placing, moving, or removing an overlay always requires an explicit rule and an associated cost.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## Noise

Noise represents political inefficiency.

Resources enter Noise when production is split or when an effect explicitly generates Noise.

Resources in Noise do not belong to any player and cannot be spent or converted.

There is currently no way to interact with Noise.

---

[CORE-14][CORE-56]

## End of the Game

The game ends after the final round resolution once no tiles can be drawn.

The player with the most influence on the board wins.
Ties are shared victories.

---

## Expansions

---

[EXP-01]
## Expansion 01 – Economy & Labor

### Overview

This expansion introduces the **Economy** resource.

Economy:
- generates **no influence**
- generates **no security**
- creates **no direct production advantages**
- operates exclusively through **costs, timing, and redistribution**

The turn structure remains **unchanged**:
1. Place a tile (if possible)
2. Perform **exactly one action**

---

### Additional Tiles

#### Economy Production Tiles

**Base Setup (2–4 players):**
- Economy (1) ×2
- Economy (2) ×1
- Economy (3) ×1

**Additional Tiles for 5–6 players:**
- +1 Economy (1)
- +1 Economy (2)
- +1 Economy (3)

Economy tiles produce **only Economy**.  
This resource is used for measures, conversion, and costs.

---

#### Focus Tile: Labor Market

- Type: Focus Tile
- Resolution: **identical to the core game**
- When fully surrounded:
  - Majority check
  - Influence is granted

The Labor Market is the **only direct influence anchor** of this expansion.

---

#### System Tile: Investment Program (Grassroots)

Effect:  
When you perform a conversion, you may exchange  
**2 Economy → 1 resource of any other domain**.

- no new action type
- uses existing conversion rules
- creates no additional triggers

---

### Measures – General Rules (Economy)

- Each expansion has its **own measure deck**
- **3 measures are always face-up**
- When a measure is taken, it is **immediately refilled**
- Instead of performing an action, a player may:
  - **take 1 face-up measure**
- Limits:
  - **max. 2 measures per player**
  - **max. 1 measure played per round**
- Each measure:
  - may be resolved **at most twice per game**
  - is recycled **once** when the deck is exhausted

---

### Measures – Economy & Labor (Final List)

#### 1. Budget Compromise
Cost: Domestic + Economy + Media  
Effect:  
A focus tile is **not resolved this round**.

---

#### 2. Economic Stimulus
Cost: Economy + Foreign  
Effect:  
One production counts as **double** this round.

---

#### 3. Collective Agreement
Cost: 2 Economy  
Effect:  
Economy **may not be converted** this round.

---

#### 4. Subsidy Reduction
Cost: Economy + Foreign  
Effect:  
Reduce the Economy yield of an opponent’s production tile  
**permanently by 1** (minimum 0).

---

### Design Notes (informative)

- Economy creates **pressure, not growth**
- All effects are **temporary or costly**
- Economy cannot replace influence

---

[EXP-02]

## Expansion 02 – Security & Order

### Overview

This expansion introduces the **Security** resource.

Security:

* generates **no production**
* creates **no influence**
* operates through **restrictions, additional costs, and prohibitions**

Security is a **controlling resource**, not a constructive one.

The turn structure of the core game remains **unchanged**:

* Place a tile (if possible)
* Perform **exactly one action**

---

### Core Mechanic: Overlays (Regulations)

#### Definition

Overlays are persistent state markers placed on tiles that modify how those tiles behave.

Overlays:

* modify **effects**, not ownership
* apply to **all players**
* remain in place until moved or removed

---

#### General Rules for Overlays

* Any overlay may be placed on **any tile**
* Multiple overlays may be placed on the **same tile**
* Overlays **stack**
* Each overlay applies its full effect independently
* Additional costs are paid **before** resolving an effect
* If additional costs cannot be paid, the effect **does not resolve**
* Removed overlays return to the **public supply**
* Overlays have **no upkeep**

---

#### Overlay Placement Cost (Canonical)

> Placing an overlay always costs **2 Security resources**.

This cost applies:

* regardless of the trigger (action, majority, or measure)
* **for each individual overlay placed**

Moving or removing overlays causes **no additional cost**
(other than potential measure costs).

---

### The Four Overlays

#### 1. Overlay: Security Level

*Reduce output*

Effect:
The effect of this tile produces **1 less unit** (minimum 0).

---

#### 2. Overlay: Control

*Increase general costs*

Effect:
Each effect on this tile costs
**+1 additional resource of any domain**.

If the resource cannot be paid, the effect **does not resolve**.

---

#### 3. Overlay: Administration

*Increase specific costs*

Effect:
Each effect on this tile costs
**+1 additional resource of any domain**.

---

#### 4. Overlay: Lock

*Prohibit action*

Effect:
The effect of this tile **cannot be resolved**.

---

### Additional Tiles

#### Focus Tile: Internal Order

Majorities on this focus tile **do not generate influence**.

Instead, the majority holder may:

* place **one overlay** of their choice, or
* move **one existing overlay**

(The normal overlay placement cost — 2 Security — still applies.)

---

#### System Tile: Bureaucratic Apparatus (Control Center)

Instead of resolving its printed effect, a player may:

* move one overlay, or
* remove one overlay

---

### Measures – Security & Order

#### General Measure Rules

* Each expansion has its **own measure deck**
* **3 face-up measures** are always available
* Instead of performing an action, a player may **take 1 face-up measure**
* A player may hold **at most 2 measures**
* A player may play **at most 1 measure per round**

---

#### Measure Lifecycle

* Played measures are placed face-up in a discard pile
* When the deck is empty:

  * the discard pile is shuffled **once** to form a new deck
* After that:

  * **no further measures** of this expansion enter the game

> Each measure may be played **at most twice per game**.

---

Cost: 2 Security
Timing: End of round
Effect: Choose a focus tile and place **exactly one overlay** of your choice.

---

#### 11. Surveillance

Cost: Security + Media
Timing: Immediate
Effect: Overlays on a chosen tile **cannot be moved or removed** until end of round.

---

#### 12. File Status

Cost: Security + Domestic
Timing: Immediate
Effect: Choose a tile with at least one overlay. One of those overlays **counts double** until end of round.

---

#### 13. Situation Assessment

Cost: Security
Timing: Start of round
Effect: Choose one:

1. Reduce the placement cost of the next overlay this round by 1 Security.
2. Reduce the removal cost of the next removed overlay this round by 1 Security.
   (Minimum cost: 1 Security.)

---

### Design Summary

* Security is **expensive, powerful, and finite**
* Overlays create **friction**, not engines
* Escalation is possible, but **never permanent**
* Removal is strong, but **never cheap**
* All rules scale consistently from **2–6 players**
