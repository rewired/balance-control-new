# Task 0015 โ Production Modifier Hook Integration (Canonical Order Preserved)

## Goal
Wire expansion hooks into the production engine while preserving the canonical production order from AGENTS ยง3.6.

This prepares EXP-01 / EXP-03 without implementing them yet.

## Inputs
- `AGENTS.md` ยง3.6 Production Engine Canonical Order
- Current core production / settlement implementation
- Core rules: production/settlement ordering must match normative spec.

## Outputs
### Code
- `@bc/rules`:
  - `collectProductionModifiers(context, enabledModules)`:
    - returns an ordered list of modifier descriptors
    - stable ordering across modules and within module
  - Integrate modifiers into production pipeline at step 3:
    1. printed value
    2. doubling
    3. production output modifiers  โ here
    4. floors
    5. majority check
    6. distribution / noise

- `@bc/game`:
  - Production/settlement code calls the hook collector derived from enabled expansion modules.
  - CORE-only behavior unchanged when no modules enabled.

### Tests
- Core-only golden test for production remains green.
- New test using a stub module that applies:
  - +1 production or -1 production modifier (whatever is easiest)
  - demonstrates that modifiers apply **exactly at step 3** and before floors/majority/distribution.

### Docs
- `/docs/changelog.md` entry: production hooks integrated.

## Constraints
- Do not implement real EXP-01/03 modifiers yet.
- Do not reorder production steps.

## Invariants
- Tie remainder to Noise must remain correct (AGENTS ยง3.6).
- Determinism preserved.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Production pipeline is hook-capable and order-correct.
- Tests cover stub modifier + core-only.
